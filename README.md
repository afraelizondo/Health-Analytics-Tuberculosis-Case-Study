# Health Analytics: Tuberculosis Case Study

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of tuberculosis incidence using recent case data, with the objective of supporting data-driven decision-making in a global health context. The analysis is framed within the scope of international public health monitoring, simulating a data analysis workflow aligned with the needs of organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO).

The project aims to prepare, analyze, and interpret tuberculosis case data in order to assess the current state of the disease, identify regional and country-level trends, and highlight areas where progress has been achieved or where additional intervention is required.

## Key Questions

 - How many tuberculosis cases are reported globally each year?

 - Which regions report the highest number of tuberculosis cases?

 - Which countries show increasing or decreasing trends in recent years?

 - Which countries are projected to experience changes in incidence in the coming years?

 - What proportion of cases corresponds to pulmonary versus extrapulmonary tuberculosis?

## Conclusions 

The final incidence analysis indicates that while certain countries have achieved sustained reductions in tuberculosis cases, several regions continue to exhibit increasing or stagnant trends. This variability reflects differences in diagnostic capacity, access to treatment, and the effectiveness of epidemiological surveillance systems, underscoring the need for country-specific analysis and targeted interventions.

From an operational and strategic perspective within a global health organization, the outcomes of this project support:

### Improved Decision-Making

 - Identification of priority countries for resource allocation, technical assistance, and targeted public health campaigns.

 - Evaluation of progress toward tuberculosis reduction targets established by international initiatives such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

### Process Improvement

 - Identification of gaps and inconsistencies in epidemiological reporting mechanisms.

 - Enablement of more agile analytical workflows through automated visualizations and basic predictive modeling.

### Data-Driven Products and Services

 - Foundation for the development of global dashboards to support continuous monitoring of tuberculosis incidence.

 - Opportunities to implement early warning systems based on trend analysis and risk indicators.

 - Prioritizing countries with recent increases in tuberculosis incidence, strengthening surveillance infrastructure, and adopting analytical tools for near real-time evaluation can support more timely decisions, more efficient operations, and accelerated progress toward tuberculosis elimination.
